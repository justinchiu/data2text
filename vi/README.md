# VI crap for IE

## TODO
* Compute marginal likelihood during eval properly, can do things in increments
or slowly since we don't need to compute gradients
* Partially Rao-Blackwellized gradient estimators? maybe later?
* Copy models?
* Need to get posteriors
* Really need to do BPTT??? How would this make sense for latent sequence models though
